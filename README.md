## Project Structure

The project consists of two main files:

1. `index.html`: This file contains the HTML structure of the portfolio page, including the navigation bar, sections for home, projects, and contact, and the footer.

2. `styles.css`: This file contains the CSS styling for the portfolio page, defining the layout, colors, and typography used in the HTML elements.

## Technologies Used

I built the portfolio page using HTML, CSS, and incorporated some external resources:

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat): I used the Montserrat font family, loaded through the Google Fonts API, to give the page a clean and professional look.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/): For the social media links in the contact section, I used Font Awesome icons to provide visual appeal.

## Features

My portfolio page comprises the following sections:

1. **Home**: Here, you'll find an introduction to me as a software developer, emphasizing my ability to convert ideas into refined and effective solutions.

2. **Projects**: This section showcases some of my notable projects. Each project item includes links to view the source code and a live demo.

3. **Contact**: In this section, you can find my social media and email links, making it easy to connect and collaborate with me.

4. **Footer**: The footer displays copyright information.

## Responsiveness

I designed the portfolio page to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes:

- For screens with a width of 0px to 767px (usually mobile devices), the navigation bar is displayed in a vertical layout, and the project items and contact icons are stacked for better readability.

- For screens with a width of 768px to 1023px (usually tablets and small desktops), the project items are slightly larger, making better use of the available space.
